# Tic-Tac-Toe

A two-player game of tic-tac-toe, using cat and dog icons for each player and a confetti cannon when a player wins.

## Instructions for play
Players take turns to select a grid cell to place their piece. The aim is to get three of their piece in a row.
A player cannot select a cell that is already occupied by another piece.
Once a player gets three of their piece in a row, a confetti cannon starts and the game is over.
